# A-LOAM
## Advanced implementation of LOAM

Forked from https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/A-LOAM/

I fixed some issues to make it work fine with ubuntu20 and noetic.

## Dependencies
Check the source abovem but these should be enough: 
Ceres Solver , PCL and PCL-conversitions
```
sudo apt install libceres-dev libpcl-dev ros-noetic-pcl-conversions

```

## Acknowledgements
Thanks for LOAM(J. Zhang and S. Singh. LOAM: Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time) and [LOAM_NOTED](https://github.com/cuitaixiang/LOAM_NOTED).
